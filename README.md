# 📱 KKW Multi-Portal Access App

A lightweight Android app designed to provide **one-tap access** to all major KKW student portals such as **LMS**, **AERP**, and the **Mobile App Development Course Site**.  
Instead of typing URLs or searching bookmarks every day, this app lets students and staff quickly open all portals through a clean WebView interface.
